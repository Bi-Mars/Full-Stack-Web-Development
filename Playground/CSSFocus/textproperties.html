<h1> Greatest Trade in History of Option Market</h1>
<p>
    One of the biggest appeal of options trading is the possibility of a large profit in a short period of time.

    This favorable profit/loss ratio is only possible with options because of the inherent leverage.

    For stocks, one call or put option represents 100 shares of stock. And when options are out of the money and are
    trading cheaply, there is even more leverage.

    Let’s examine three of the best options trades in recent history that have capitalized on this leverage.

<h2>TRADE #1: $2.4 Million in 28 Minutes </h2>
<p>
    On March 27, 2015, the owner of an unidentified trading algorithm that instantaneously reads and digests news
    headlines made a little over $2,400,000 in just 28 minutes by buying $110,000 worth of call options on Altera stock.

    This was back when Intel (ticker symbol INTC) was in “talks” to buy Altera (ticker symbol ALTR).

    Within approximately 2 seconds of the buyout rumor surfacing on Dow Jones Newswires, the algo scooped up about 3,158
    call options with a strike price of $36. The price was $0.35 for each contract.

    At the time, ALTR was trading around $34 per share. This meant the $36 strike price options were out of the money,
    and cost $110,530 to purchase. After the news, ALTR stock was halted and reopened 28% higher.

    Remember, if options were to expire out of the money, they would be worthless, so this was an inherently risky
    trade. If the trader purchased $100k worth of ALTR stock, that wouldn’t be at risk of expiring worthless, although
    ALTR could technically trade to zero.

    Since ALTR traded 28% higher about 30 minutes after the calls were purchased, the profit was enormous.

<h2> TRADE #2: $250,000 Selling Put Options </h2>
<p>
    If you traded at all on August 24th, 2015, when markets around the world effectively crashed 10% due to China
    devaluing its currency, then you know firsthand how chaotic the markets truly were. Amidst the chaos, there was an
    enormous amount of opportunity.

    For one daytrader based in Japan who goes by the name CIS, a whopping fortune of $34,000,000 was made in one single
    day. Although most of the millions he made that day came from shorting Nikkei index futures, he made a quarter of a
    million dollars by selling overpriced put options to investors that panicked.
    After closing out his short position in the Nikkei index futures, he noticed far out of the money puts were trading
    for a heavy premium.

    In order for the puts to be worth something, the Nikkei would have had to fall below 10,500 (a 40% decrease). CIS
    saw this as very unlikely and was more than happy to sell $250,o000 worth of options premium.

    Shortly after he placed this trade, the Nikkei started to rebound and volatility collapsed. The puts ended up
    expiring worthless and CIS collected more money from selling put options than most people will see in their entire
    lives.
